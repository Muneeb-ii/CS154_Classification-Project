# Classification with Naive Bayes

This project involves building Naive Bayes classifiers using real-world datasets to classify messages or news articles into meaningful categories. Two datasets ‚Äî **SMSSpamCollection** and **German_dataset** ‚Äî were explored, preprocessed, and modeled using scikit-learn tools. Developed as part of **CS154**, an introductory Python course with NLP components.

## üìå Features

- Custom classification pipelines built using:
  - `CountVectorizer` and `TfidfVectorizer` for feature extraction
  - `MultinomialNB` for classification
  - `train_test_split` for model evaluation
- Dataset-specific preprocessing to handle:
  - Tab-delimited text files (SMSSpamCollection)
  - Non-standard separators and multiple label types (German_dataset)
- Customized data visualizations for multiclass text data
- Emphasis on reading documentation and understanding built-in Python libraries

## üß† Reflections

- **SMSSpamCollection**: Modeling was straightforward using the example notebook. The only challenge was handling tab-separated values, which was resolved by explicitly specifying `\t` as the separator.
- **German_dataset**: Required careful parsing. I read each line individually and split using the first semicolon due to inconsistent formatting. For visualizations, I resized figures and rotated labels to avoid x-axis text overlap when plotting 9+ categories.
- This project taught me how to adapt existing ML workflows to new datasets and troubleshoot issues with parsing, plotting, and classification accuracy.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muneebnafees/CS154_Classification-Project.git
   cd CS154_Classification-Project
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```

3. Open and run the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook classification_project.ipynb
   ```

4. You‚Äôll find two workflows inside:
   - **Spam Classifier** (SMSSpamCollection)
   - **News Topic Classifier** (German_dataset)

## üìä Datasets

- **SMSSpamCollection** ‚Äì Classify messages as spam or not spam
- **German_dataset** ‚Äì Classify news into ~9 categories based on text type
